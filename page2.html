    <h1>A letter for you before 2026</h1>
    <p>Do you remember the game where we first met?</p>
    <p>I was sad back then, and somehow… you found me.</p>
    <p>When you suddenly said, “I love you,” I laughed so hard. The hardest I’ve laughed all year.</p>
    <p>From that moment, I wanted to know you more.</p>
    <p>And when we started talking on Instagram, wow… you left me speechless.</p>
    <p>I never thought I would find someone like you in this lifetime.</p>
    <p>I’m always grateful to have you in my life. Even though we’ve only known each other for a short time, I already feel so loved.</p>
    <p>You’re my best plot twist this year, haha.</p>
    <p>Even if it’s only been about a month, I already see you as my future.</p>
    <p>I want a life with you, a life where we’re happy together, forever.</p>
    <p>A life where our kids say, “Mom, stop flirting with Dad,” and we just laugh.</p>
    <p>There’s no one else I can imagine by my side. You are someone worth waiting for, my soul’s softest place to land, my everything.</p>
    <p>I know it isn’t always easy for us, but I believe we’re strong enough to grow through every challenge together.</p>
    <p>And one day, we’ll look back and smile, knowing we really did it.</p>
    <p>
    As this year comes to an end, I want you to know how much I truly appreciate you.
    Even in the quiet moments and unspoken days, you mattered more than you ever realized.
    </p>
    <p>In another life, I’d still choose you, even if I had to find you all over again.</p>

    <p>Because you are the one my heart belongs to, and I would choose you every single damn time.</p>
    <p>I love you so much, my love. I never knew I could fall this deeply for someone, and I’m so glad it’s you, Elison Bernthal.</p>
